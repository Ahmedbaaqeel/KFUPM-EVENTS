# KFUPM EVENTS
This web project main idea is to solve the issue of the clubs and the students which was a couble of things, getting too many emails from unwanted clubs, not having a main frame to look for club events, for the managers it's diffucilt to create an event, organize it, and send it to the students. So, we made KFUPM EVENTS to have a dashboard for the managers and the student who are intrested. This website has login, register, showing the events on the main page, students registering in the events, event details and the addition of events. 
## Work distribution
I mainly worked on the backend part of the project. Maneged the team at the last 1.5 days and made the most of what we could get out of us. Unfortunatly, we didn't have the front end cababilties to create a good UI.
